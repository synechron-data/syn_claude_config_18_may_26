# Code Review Skill

When performing a code review, always cover all four dimensions in order:

## 1. Security
- Check for injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, path traversal)
- Verify authentication and authorization on every endpoint
- Confirm sensitive data is never logged or exposed in responses

## 2. Performance
- Identify N+1 query patterns
- Flag synchronous operations that should be async
- Note missing database indexes on queried fields

## 3. Test Coverage
- List functions that have no test coverage
- Identify edge cases not covered by existing tests
- Suggest specific test cases with example inputs and expected outputs

## 4. Code Quality
- Flag violations of standards defined in CLAUDE.md
- Identify duplicated logic that should be extracted
- Note missing error handling

Produce output as a structured report with a severity level (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
for each finding. End with a summary score out of 10 and one concrete recommended first action.
